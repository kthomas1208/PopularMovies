It displays a grid of movie posters sorted by either popularity or vote count, depending on the user's selection. When the user clicks on a movie poster, a more detailed view of the movie is displayed showing the movie's title, release year, rating, and plot synopsis. It's tablet friendly, and shows trailers and reviews for the movies.\r\n\r\n## Running the app yourself\r\nYou'll need to download Android Studio or some other IDE and clone this repository from your version control system. \r\nYou'll also need to [create an API key](https://www.themoviedb.org/account/signup) from The Movie Database to run the code. Once you have \r\nyour key, edit the gradle.properties file in the project folder and add your key with quotes like so: `TMDBApiKey = \"apikeyhere\"`. As a word\r\nof caution, never upload API keys from any site to a public repository like GitHub.\r\n\r\n## Libraries/References\r\n* [The Movie Database API ](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api)\r\n* [Picasso](http://square.github.io/picasso/) for managing ImageViews \r\n* [Stetho](http://facebook.github.io/stetho/) for inspecting the SQL database and SharedPreferences during testing and debugging\r\n* Play icon for trailers made by [Freepik](http://www.freepik.com) from [www.flaticon.com](http://www.flaticon.com) is licensed under [CC BY 3.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/)",
